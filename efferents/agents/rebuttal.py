"""Rebuttal agent — Student's one-shot response to the 3-reviewer board.

Called after `reviewer.review(...)` returns three reviews for a paper that
cleared the mechanical `should_publish` gate. The rebuttal is the author's
*only* response (one-shot system — no revise-and-resubmit). It addresses
each reviewer's `questions` and `weaknesses`, acknowledges valid
criticism, and defends where appropriate. It does NOT promise future
experiments — those would never run since the editor decides immediately.

The rebuttal lands at `paper/<campaign_id>.rebuttal.md` and is included
verbatim in the decision context (when peer-review pipeline composes
the final accept/reject decision).

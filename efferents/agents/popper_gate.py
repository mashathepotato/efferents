# Lab charter

This file tracks the lab's research direction as it passes through the
Popper Probe: the initial direction prompted by the lab's funder, and every
subsequent probed hypothesis that opened a new line of work.

**How students and supervisors should use it.** Read this before proposing
or prioritizing work. It orients: it says where the lab started, what design
decisions were made at each gate, and why. It does not bind: requirements
change, and when the evidence says the direction should move, amend this
file (append below — never rewrite earlier entries) rather than obey it.
Proposals that depart from the charter are legitimate; silent departures are
not. When classifying or onboarding new students, use the entries below to
decide which lines of work a student continues versus opens fresh.

## Entries
